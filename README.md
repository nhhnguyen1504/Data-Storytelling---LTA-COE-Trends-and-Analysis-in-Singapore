# AB0403 | Data Storytelling - LTA COE Trends and Analysis in Singapore

## Project Description
This project explores the factors driving the high demand for Certificate of Entitlement (COE) in Singapore, despite the increasing costs and the presence of an efficient public transport network. Using datasets from the Land Transport Authority (LTA), our goal is to analyze trends in COE prices, car ownership, and public transport adoption. The insights derived from this project aim to support LTA's vision of creating a greener, more inclusive transport system that integrates walking, cycling, and public transport options, while curbing excessive reliance on private cars.

## Project Requirements
Our analysis is based on three main datasets:

- COE.csv: Trends in COE prices and quotas over time for different vehicle categories.
- TotalAnnualNewRegistrationByMake.csv: New car registrations by vehicle make.
- AnnualAgeDistributionofCars.csv: Age distribution of cars in Singapore.

We combined these datasets with external research to identify inefficiencies in vehicle quotas and to offer recommendations on how LTA can reduce car demand in favor of public transport.

## Outcomes

### Target Audience:
The primary audience for this project is the Land Transport Authority (LTA), whose role is to manage and develop Singapore's transport infrastructure with a strong emphasis on sustainability and inclusivity. Our findings are intended to help LTA balance the challenges of private car ownership while promoting public transport, cycling, and walking as viable, attractive alternatives.

### What We Have Done:
- Trend Analysis: Investigated the rise in COE prices and its effects on demand for cars in Categories A and B.
- Impact of Quota Adjustments: Examined how COE quotas influence market demand and pricing, with an emphasis on the impact of LTA's zero-growth policy for cars.
- Car Registrations and COE: Uncovered correlations between COE prices and car registrations, shedding light on buyer behavior across various vehicle makes.
- Age of Vehicles: Assessed how COE policies affect the age distribution of vehicles, providing insights into vehicle lifecycles and their alignment with LTA's emissions goals.
- Supply and Demand: Analyzed the dynamics of supply (COE quotas) and demand (bids received), particularly for private and commercial vehicles.

### Findings:
- Why Demand Persists: Despite LTA’s ongoing expansion of public transport networks, private car ownership remains highly desirable due to factors such as convenience, family needs, and social status. High COE prices have not significantly curbed this demand.
- COE Policy Limitations: The current COE pricing and quota system creates inefficiencies, particularly in Category A, where prices are driven by sustained demand. Policies like the Vehicular Emissions Scheme (VES) have yet to significantly shift consumer preferences toward more environmentally friendly options.
- Public Transport Gaps: Although MRT and bus networks have grown, the convenience and flexibility of private car ownership still outweigh public transport for many households, especially those with children and elderly members.

### Our Solution:

To align with LTA’s vision of a greener, more connected public transport system, we recommend:

- Enhanced Car and Bike-Sharing Schemes: Increase access to shared mobility options to provide affordable and flexible alternatives to car ownership, encouraging a shift toward sustainable transport.
- Targeted Public Transport Expansion: Address gaps in public transport accessibility, particularly in underserved neighborhoods, by extending MRT, bus routes, and cycling paths as outlined in LTA's 2040 Master Plan.
- Incentive Programs: Further incentivize car-sharing through CDC vouchers, making it more attractive for households that would otherwise rely on private car ownership.

## Skills Involved and Developed
- Data Analysis: Cleaning and interpreting large datasets to uncover actionable insights.
- Data Storytelling: Communicating complex data through visualizations and clear narratives.
- Market Research: Integrating external data sources and reports to support findings.
- Problem-Solving: Developing policy recommendations based on data-driven insights to align with LTA's goals.
- Collaboration and Communication: Coordinating effectively as a team to ensure cohesive analysis and presentation to stakeholders.
